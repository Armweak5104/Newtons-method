# Newtons-method
 This program uses Newtons method to find the roots of a function (defined within the source code). As the formula is based on an approximation
 from a formula, the more iterations you have and the closer your initial guess to the actual guess, the closer the guess to the actual root.
 However, you do NOT need to have an accurate guess, just ensure you have many iterations and enough computer strength to run the code. Any ideas
 to optimise the code are appreciated, enjoy.
